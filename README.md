**designlang** points a headless browser at any URL and reads the design system off the live DOM. One command emits 17+ files — DTCG tokens, Tailwind config, shadcn theme, Figma variables, motion tokens, typed component anatomy, brand voice, page-intent labels, and a paste-ready prompt pack for v0 / Lovable / Cursor / Claude Artifacts.

It also goes where extractors don't: **layout patterns**, **responsive behavior across 4 breakpoints**, **hover / focus / active states**, **WCAG contrast scoring**, **multi-page consistency**, **drift checks against a live source-of-truth**, **visual-diffs**, and a **shareable graded report card**.

## Watch it read — live Extraction Theatre (`v13`)

Don't take the output on faith — **watch it happen.** On
[designlang.app/watch](https://designlang.app/watch) you paste a URL and a real
headless Chromium opens the page and reads its entire design system in real
time: a split stage with the live browser on the left and the design system —
palette, type, spacing, motion — assembling itself on the right as each token
lifts off the page.

It's driven by the *actual* extraction (the browser's CDP screencast streamed
frame-by-frame alongside the real token events), recorded so a shared link
replays the exact run. No install, no account. Every gallery card can be watched
the same way, and the [gallery](https://designlang.app/gallery) now spans **37
real-graded design systems**.

## Whole-site design system (`site`)

Most extractors read a single URL. `designlang site` crawls a site's canonical
pages (home, pricing, docs, blog, about, product…) and synthesizes **one**
de-duplicated system. Every token is elected by *coverage* — the share of pages
that use it — so what's genuinely site-wide is separated from one-off,
page-local choices. Near-identical colours are merged in OKLab. It's fully
deterministic and free; no API key.

```bash
npx designlang site stripe.com --max-pages 8
```

You get, alongside the standard pack emitted from the **canonical** system:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `*-site-system.json` | canonical unified tokens + coverage + drift |
| `*-site-coverage.md` | every token tagged 🟢 site-wide / 🟡 section / 🔴 page-local, with the pages using it |
| `*-site-consistency.md` | a 0–100 consistency grade, per-category breakdown, and the off-system outliers to consolidate |

## Measured clone fidelity (`fidelity` + `gallery`)

Cloning tools all *claim* "pixel-perfect" — none of them **measure** it. `designlang
fidelity` does. Point it at the original and your clone (often a local dev
server) and it returns one honest number, both halves of the clone:

- **Visual** — full-page screenshots of each, pixel-diffed.
- **Motion** — `extractMotion()` on both, compared across feel, durations,
  easings, springs, keyframe kinds, scroll-linked motion, and choreography/
  stagger. (Most clones reproduce static pixels and drop the motion entirely;
  this is where they lose.)

The two blend into a 0–100 score + letter grade, and — the part competitors
don't ship — a **ranked correction plan**: the exact next edits that will raise
the score, hardest-hitting first. Measure → fix → re-run until it converges.

```bash
npx designlang fidelity https://stripe.com --clone http://localhost:3000 --clone-local
npx designlang fidelity https://stripe.com --clone http://localhost:3000 --clone-local --min 90   # CI gate
```

`--clone-local` is required when the clone runs on `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` or
`http://localhost:<port>`. It is the only loopback allowance in the tool, it
applies to the clone side of this command alone, and the full-page screenshot
lane of this command is not proxied. The report also carries a **blueprint**
score (`fidelity-blueprint.json`): band count, reading order and per-band
checks of the clone against the original.

Generating the clone with `designlang clone`? Add `--fidelity` and it grades the
clone's token basis against the live site the moment it's built — writing
`FIDELITY.md` + a correction plan straight into the project, no separate step:

```bash
npx designlang clone https://stripe.com --fidelity
```

You get `fidelity.md` (score + motion table + correction plan), `fidelity.json`,
a shareable `fidelity-card.svg` (`88% · B · stripe.com`), and a `fidelity-diff.png`
loss heatmap.

Then publish them. `designlang gallery` scans your reports and builds a
deployable static site — an index of score cards plus a permalink page per clone
(each with an OG card, so a shared link unfurls the number).

```bash
npx designlang gallery --title "Our clones" --base-url https://clones.example.com
```

## A measured design space (`dna`)

Every extractor on the market answers *what* a design uses. None of them answers
**where it sits**. `designlang grade` returns a letter — but a letter with no
reference frame is a thermometer with no scale on it.

`designlang dna` reduces a design to **30 deterministic features** across five
axes — colour, type, space, shape, motion — and ranks it against a corpus of
real design systems:

```bash
npx designlang dna raycast.com
```

```
  Design DNA · https://raycast.com
  30 features, 100% measurable

  vs 8 systems (default)

  color    65th percentile
  type     56th percentile
  space    42th percentile
  shape    79th percentile
  motion   67th percentile

  Nearest
  0.14  https://railway.app
  0.15  https://linear.app
  0.19  https://notion.so
```

Distance is the mean absolute difference across the features both designs have,
so `0.14` reads as "the average feature is 14% of its range apart" — a number you
can reason about, unlike a Euclidean distance in 30 dimensions.

The report goes past similarity to **what makes a design look the way it does**:
the features furthest from the middle of the corpus, in plain language
(*"corner radius — 100th percentile, far above the corpus"*).

Bring your own reference frame — your products, your competitors, a target look:

```bash
npx designlang dna-corpus acme.com acme.com/pricing competitor.com
npx designlang dna acme.com/new-page --corpus ./corpus.json
```

Three things it refuses to do, because a design score that overclaims is worse
than no score at all:

- **A missing measurement stays missing.** Features the page never exposed are
  `null`, never a substituted midpoint, and distance skips them instead of
  comparing against an invented value.
- **Every number carries its evidence.** Distances report how many features
  backed them, percentiles name the corpus and its size, and the report warns
  when coverage was partial.
- **The space is versioned.** Feature order and normalization are frozen per
  vector version, and a corpus built by different rules is rejected rather than
  silently compared against.

## Install

```bash
npm i -g designlang                         # global
npx skills add Manavarya09/design-extract   # as an agent skill (40+ agents)
```

## Use in Claude Code (plugin)

designlang ships as a **Claude Code plugin** — eleven slash commands that wrap
the CLI. Install it from inside Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add Manavarya09/design-extract
/plugin install designlang@designlang
```

The first command registers this repo as a plugin marketplace; the second
installs the `designlang` plugin from it. Restart Claude Code if prompted, then
the commands are available:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/extract <url>` | full design language → DTCG, Tailwind, Figma, motion, voice |
| `/site <url>` | crawl a whole site → one canonical design system + consistency grade |
| `/grade <url>` | shareable HTML report card + SVG badge |
| `/battle <a> <b>` | head-to-head graded comparison |
| `/remix <url> --as <vocab>` | restyle in 6 vocabularies (brutalist, swiss, art-deco, cyberpunk, soft-ui, editorial) |
| `/pack <url>` | one downloadable design-system bundle |
| `/theme-swap <url>` | OKLCH-correct recolour around a new brand primary |
| `/brand <url>` | full editorial brand-guidelines book (13 chapters) |
| `/pair <a> <b>` | fuse two designs across configurable axes |
| `/studio` | live token editor — preview, dark mode, export, share |
| `/verify <url>` | rebuild from tokens, pixel-diff vs live, fidelity score |
| `/fidelity <url> --clone <url>` | score a clone vs the original (visual + motion) + correction plan |
| `/gallery [dir]` | build a static shareable gallery of measured clones |
| `/dna <url>` | place a design in the measured design space — nearest systems, per-axis percentiles, outliers |

> Prefer the raw MCP tools? The CLI also ships an MCP server — run
> `designlang mcp --output-dir ./design-extract-output` to serve the latest
> extraction's tokens to any MCP client.

## Atlas Cloud for `--smart`

`designlang --smart` can now use Atlas Cloud through its OpenAI-compatible chat API, so low-confidence classifiers can stay zero-dependency while routing to Atlas-hosted models.

```bash
export ATLASCLOUD_API_KEY="<atlascloud-api-key>"
export ATLASCLOUD_MODEL="deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-pro"

npx designlang https://stripe.com --smart
```

- Atlas Cloud envs: `ATLASCLOUD_API_KEY`, `ATLASCLOUD_MODEL`, optional `ATLASCLOUD_API_BASE`
- Alias envs also work: `ATLAS_CLOUD_API_KEY`, `ATLAS_CLOUD_MODEL`, `ATLAS_CLOUD_API_BASE`
- Existing `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` flows keep working unchanged

## What you get

Each run writes 17+ files to `./design-extract-output/`. The headline outputs:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `*-design-language.md` | 19-section markdown — feed any LLM to recreate the design |
| `*-design-tokens.json` | W3C DTCG tokens (primitive + semantic + composite layers) |
| `*-tailwind.config.js` | Drop-in Tailwind theme |
| `*-shadcn-theme.css` | shadcn/ui `globals.css` variables |
| `*-figma-variables.json` | Figma Variables import (light + dark) |
| `*-variables.css` | CSS custom properties |
| `*-anatomy.tsx` | Typed React stubs for every detected component + variants |
| `*-motion-tokens.json` | Durations, easings, springs, scroll-linked flag; with `--motion-runtime` also choreography (stagger) + scroll recipes + observed durations |
| `*-blueprint.json` | The page as ordered horizontal bands: bounds, background, columns, media, heading, role, reveal, reading order and hero index |
| `*-voice.json` | Brand voice — tone, pronoun posture, CTA verbs |
| `*-prompts/` | Paste-ready prompts for v0, Lovable, Cursor, Claude Artifacts |
| `*-mcp.json` | Disk-backed MCP server payload |
| `*-grade.html` | **v12.1** Shareable Design Report Card (letter grade + evidence) |
| `*-grade.svg` | **v12.2** Shields.io-style design-score badge (drop into any README) |
| `*-battle.html` | **v12.2** Head-to-head graded battle card from `designlang battle` |
| `*-remix.<vocab>.html` | **v12.3** Site restyled in another vocabulary — brutalist / swiss / art-deco / cyberpunk / soft-ui / editorial |

Multi-platform (`--platforms web,ios,android,flutter,wordpress,all`) adds `ios/`, `android/`, `flutter/`, and a WordPress block theme. `--emit-agent-rules` adds Cursor / Claude Code / generic agent rule files.

## Why designlang vs anything else

Other tools give you the paint. designlang reads the architecture:

- **Layout system** — grids, flex containers, container widths, gaps — not just tokens.
- **Responsive** — crawls 4 breakpoints and reports what changes (`--responsive`).
- **Interaction states** — programmatically hovers and focuses, captures the deltas (`--interactions`, `--deep-interact`).
- **Motion language** — durations, easing families, spring detection, scroll-linked flag, `feel` fingerprint (springy / smooth / mechanical / mixed).
- **Runtime motion (`--motion-runtime`)** — drives the page (load / scroll / hover / focus) and reads `document.getAnimations()` to capture what *actually* animates: real durations, **choreography/stagger** sequences, and **scroll recipes** (parallax / reveal / pin). Folded into `*-motion-tokens.json` and previewable live in the studio's Motion tab.
- **Component anatomy** — slot trees with variant × size × state matrices, emitted as typed `.tsx`.
- **Brand voice** — tone, pronoun posture, heading style, CTA verb inventory.
- **Page intent + section roles** — `landing` / `pricing` / `docs` etc., with semantic regions (`hero`, `feature-grid`, `pricing-table`, `cta`…).
- **Multi-page consistency** — auto-discovers canonical pages, reconciles shared vs per-route tokens.
- **WCAG** — every fg/bg pair scored, with a remediation palette suggesting nearest passing colors.
- **Drift + lint + visual-diff** — `designlang drift`, `lint`, `visual-diff` all CI-ready, exit non-zero on failure.
- **Live-site sync** — treat the deployed site as source of truth (`designlang sync`).
- **MCP server** — `designlang mcp` exposes tokens, regions, components, and contrast pairs to any MCP-aware agent.

## Example output

`designlang https://vercel.com --full` →

```
Colors: 27 · Fonts: Geist + Geist Mono · Spacing: 18 (base 2px)
Shadows: 11 · Radii: 10 · CSS vars: 407 · Layout: 55 grids / 492 flex
Responsive: 4 viewports, 3 breakpoint changes · Interactions: 8 transitions
A11y: 94% WCAG · Score: 68/100 (D) · 4 issues

→ 17 files written to ./design-extract-output/
→ Run `designlang grade https://vercel.com` for a shareable report card
```

## How it works

1. **Crawl** — Headless Chromium via Playwright, waits for network idle and fonts
2. **Extract** — One `page.evaluate()` walks up to 5,000 DOM elements, collecting 25+ computed properties, inline SVGs, font sources, and image metadata
3. **Process** — 17 extractor modules parse, deduplicate, cluster, and classify the raw data
4. **Format** — 12+ formatter modules emit the output files
5. **Score** — Accessibility extractor calculates WCAG contrast ratios for all color pairs
6. **Capture** — Optional: screenshots, responsive viewport crawling, interaction state recording

## Install Everywhere

designlang ships surfaces beyond the CLI:

| Surface | Path | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **CLI** | `npx designlang <url>` | Main entry point. |
| **Raycast extension** | [`raycast-extension/`](raycast-extension/) | Extract, score, and "copy CLI command" from Raycast. |
| **Figma plugin** | [`figma-plugin/`](figma-plugin/) | Paste a URL inside Figma, get a full Variables collection. |
| **GitHub Action** | [`github-action/`](github-action/) | "Design regression guard" — diffs tokens on every PR and comments. |
| **Chrome extension** | [`chrome-extension/`](chrome-extension/) | One-click handoff from any tab (MV3, `activeTab` only). |
| **Doctor** | `designlang doctor` | One-screen health check of the local install — Node, playwright, Chromium binary, output dir, network. Exits `1` if anything fails. |
| **MCP server** | `npx designlang mcp` | Exposes the extracted design as MCP resources + tools for Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, etc. See [`docs/MCP-REGISTRY.md`](docs/MCP-REGISTRY.md). |
| **Claude Code plugin** | [`.claude-plugin/`](.claude-plugin/) | Five slash commands inside Claude Code — `/extract`, `/grade`, `/battle`, `/remix`, `/pack`. |

## Claude Code plugin

Drop designlang straight into Claude Code as a plugin. Every CLI command becomes a slash command:

```bash
/plugin install Manavarya09/design-extract
```

Then inside any Claude Code session:

| Slash command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/extract <url>` | Full extraction → DTCG tokens, Tailwind, Figma vars, motion, voice |
| `/grade <url>` | Shareable HTML "Design Report Card" (+ `--badge` for an SVG) |
| `/battle <urlA> <urlB>` | Head-to-head graded battle card |
| `/remix <url> --as <vocab>` | Restyle in brutalist / swiss / art-deco / cyberpunk / soft-ui / editorial |
| `/pack <url>` | Bundle every output into one design-system directory |

Manifest: [`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`](.claude-plugin/plugin.json) · marketplace: [`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json) · commands: [`commands/`](commands/) · skills: [`skills/`](skills/).

## Agent skill (other ecosystems)

Works with **Cursor, Codex, and 40+ AI coding agents** via the skills ecosystem:

```bash
npx skills add Manavarya09/design-extract
```

In Cursor / Codex / etc., use `/extract-design <url>`.
